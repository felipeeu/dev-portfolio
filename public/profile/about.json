  "about": "I'm a passionate science enthusiast with a background in chemistry and education, who found a new love in software development. My journey started in a science museum, where I usually ignited a spark in visitors through interactive exhibits. I then change to education area as a chemistry monitor, lab assistant, and teacher, gaining valuable teaching and research experience. However, my love for technology propelled me towards software development. Now, I use my skills in JavaScript (including Salesforce JS Dev certification!), **React JS/Native, Clojure(script), Re-frame, Typescript, Next.js, Node, and GraphQL** to build user-friendly and functional applications. Additionally, I'm a certified **Mulesoft Developer** and **Salesforce JS Developer**, further expanding my tech toolkit. A constant learner, I thrive on tackling problems creatively and collaborating with teams to build robust software. My passion lies in continuous growth and mastering new technologies.",
